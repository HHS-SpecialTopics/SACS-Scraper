# SACS Scraper
This repository contains the materials for scraping news posts off of the Southwest Allen County Schools homepage.

## Note
In order to operate correctly, the JAR file needs to have the accompanying `scraper_lib` folder placed inside of the `bin` folder.  For licensing reasons, this folder is not included.  However, the JAR files required are [Jaunt](http://jaunt-api.com/) and [JSON.simple](http://code.google.com/p/json-simple/).
